Exploratory data analysis of Netflix titles using Excel
This is my first data analytics project! I used Microsoft Excel to explore and visualize trends in Netflix's global content catalog from 2008 to 2019.

### ✅ What I Did:
- Cleaned and organized 6,000+ Netflix titles from 2008 to 2019
- Separated movies from TV shows
- Analyzed content duration, ratings, and release year
- Built charts and pivot tables in Excel

### 🔍 Key Insights:
- TV Shows make up a growing share of Netflix content
- Most titles were released after 2015
- "TV-MA" is the most frequent rating — mature audiences dominate

### 📁 Files Included:
- `netflix_titles_cleaned.xlsx`: The cleaned dataset
- `Netflix_Charts.png`: Key visuals from the analysis

🧠 Built entirely in Excel — no code required. This project helped build foundational skills in data wrangling, storytelling, and visualization.
